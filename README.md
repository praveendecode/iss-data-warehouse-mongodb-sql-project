# Overview

In this project, the raw API data of the International Space Station (ISS) is transformed into MongoDB documents and SQL records. The project aims to unlock valuable insights that are helpful for communication timestamp analysis, message content analysis, and more. This is achieved through the effective storage capabilities of MongoDB's document-oriented storage and SQL's relational database management.
Features

    Data Transformation: Raw ISS API data is transformed into MongoDB documents and SQL records.
    Communication Analysis: The project enables communication timestamp analysis and message content analysis.
    Storage Efficiency: MongoDB's document-oriented storage and SQL's relational database management provide efficient data storage solutions.

# Getting Started

### Step 1: Install/Import Required Libraries

    Ensure the necessary libraries are installed or imported: Streamlit, Pandas, JSON, PyMongo, Requests, Time, and Psycopg2.
    
### Step 2: Utilize the 'API2MongoSQL' Class

    Inside the class, there are six methods that handle the transformation and management of data:

    API iss data converted into MongoDB Documents
    Fetch MongoDB Documents
    Converting MongoDB Documents Into SQL Records
    Fetch SQL Table Records
    Delete Document in Mongo Collection
    Delete SQL Records
    Note : Streamlit is integrated for GUI purposes.

    
### Step 3: Run the Project with Streamlit

    Open the command prompt in the directory where the "DataSyncPro.py" file is located. Execute the command: streamlit run DataSyncPro.py. It will open in a web browser.4
    
### Step 4: Configure Databases

Make sure to connect your MongoDB Atlas and PostgresSQL DBMS in your local setup.
