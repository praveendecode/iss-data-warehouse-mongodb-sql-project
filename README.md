# DataSyncPro Project


### In this project , I have transformed the raw API data of ' International Space Station' (ISS)  into   MongoDB   documents , SQL records . With this project we are unlocking the valuable insights that would be helpful for Communication timestamp analysis , message content analysis and more with effective storage power of MongoDB's document-oriented storage and SQL's relational database management

## Explanation To Do Project : 

     #### Step 1: Install/Import Streamlit , pandas , json , pymongo , requestes , time , psycopg2  

     #### Step 2: I have created 6 different methods inside the class "API2MongoSQL" 
                  
                   Process of Methods :

                               Method 1 :  API iss data  conveted into  to Mongodb Documents

                               Method 2 :  Fetch Mongo Documents 

                               Method 3 :  Coverting Mongo Documents Into Sql Records

                               Method 4:   Fetch Sql Table Records 

                               Method 5 :  Delete Document In Mongo Collection

                               Method 6 :  Delete Sql Records
                               
    #### Step 3 :  Run  Command prompt  with file location path that where you have the  "DataSyncPro.py" file ,
                   In CMD do type this command "streamlit run DataSyncPro.py" It will open on web browers that what youi have eg: Google Chrome

    #### Step 4 : Make sure to connect your mongodb atlas and SQL DBMS
