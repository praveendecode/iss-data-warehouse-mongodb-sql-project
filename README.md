# DataSyncPro Project


### In  this  project , I  have  transformed  the  raw  API data  of  ' International Space Station' (ISS)   into   MongoDB  documents , SQL records . With  this project  we  are  unlocking  the  valuable  insights  that  would  be  helpful  for  Communication timestamp analysis ,  message content analysis  and  more  with effective  storage  power  of MongoDB's document-oriented storage  and  SQL's relational database management

## Explanation To Do Execute The  Project : 

      Step 1: Install/Import Streamlit , pandas , json , pymongo , requestes , time , psycopg2  

      Step 2: I have created 6 different methods inside the class "API2MongoSQL" 
                  
                   Process of Methods :

                               Method 1 :  API iss data  conveted into  to Mongodb Documents

                               Method 2 :  Fetch Mongo Documents 

                               Method 3 :  Coverting Mongo Documents Into Sql Records

                               Method 4:   Fetch Sql Table Records 

                               Method 5 :  Delete Document In Mongo Collection

                               Method 6 :  Delete Sql Records
                               
     Step 3 :  Run  Command prompt  with file location path that where you have the  "DataSyncPro.py" file ,
               In CMD do type this command  "streamlit run DataSyncPro.py"  . It will open on web browers that what you have eg: Google Chrome

     Step 4 : Make sure to connect your mongodb atlas and PostgresSQL DBMS  in your local setup , brower  theme should be  in dark
